Once upon a time there was a magic chipmunk named Squeezy.  Squeezy
had three magic powers: he could turn anything into a mushroom, he
could fly under the water, and he could sound like a butterfly.  One
day he was scampering along a branch in a tree when he heard a yell.
"Help! Magic chipmunk Squeezy, help us!"  He looked down and saw three
people on the ground.  And they were running away from the
tri-wave-taker!  And he floated down to them.  And he listened to what
Noah was saying.  And he saw the tri-wave-taker and he looked at it.
He gave him The Look.  And he had an idea!  He ran back to his house
and came back as quickly as a lightning bolt!  First he used his power
to sound like a butterfly, and the tri-wave-taker stopped.
(Tri-wave-takers don't like butterflies.)  Then he turned the
tri-wave-taker into a mushroom.  And then he ate the mushroom with the
soy sauce he brought from his house.
