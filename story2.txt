Once upon a time, there was Noah and Brent.  They were having a
picnic. And one day, there was.... a giNORmous... MONSTER!!!  And Noah
said, "What do I do?"  And I thought and thought and thought.  And I
had an idea!  A GREAT idea!  And the idea was that I would use my
super speed.  So, I activated my super cat speed and then the monster
said that he would get them to jail.  And suddenly, he didn't even
notice that I was using my super cat speed!  And I... grabbed his leg
just as he was going to pick Brent up to jail!  And before he touched
him with his monster fingernails, I super cat speeded grabbed his leg
and I tied him up to jail.  And we had a nice picnic.

THE END.
