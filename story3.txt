Once upon a time, there was a frog named Norman.  Norman the frog
liked to sit in his pond and think.  And one day, Noah came marching
up the path.  And the frog saw him coming.  He hid in his pool and
jumped into it!  And Noah stopped right in front of something big.
Noah thought and thought and thought.  Before he knew it, something
was glowing inside it!  He looked with his Octo-Goggles and I saw
something inside.  And I---what!?  "What is that?"  He knew what it
was.  It was a tanimorus.  Tanimoruses are predators.  They only eat
meat and chickens.  And this creature is so small but it eats very big
meals.  THE END.
