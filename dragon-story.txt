Once upon a time there was a sweet boy named Noah.  He was the bestest
boy in the whole wide world. And his daddy loved him very much.

One day they decided to visit the daddy's office at Hondrax
College. They were having fun listening to music and telling stories.
SUDDENLY, a dragon came out of the closet!!!  He said, "WHO WOKE ME
UP???  I'M GOING TO GOBBLE YOU DOWN."

But Noah said, "Shoo away, you naughty monster!"  But the dragon said,
"No! I'm going to GOBBLE YOU DOWN."  Then Noah said, "Get away from
here now, dragon monster!"  But the dragon kept coming closer.  He was
about to eat them!  Then Noah used his SUPER SPEED and ran around and
pulled the dragon's tail!  "OUCH!" said the dragon.  He started to
cry.  "What's wrong, dragon?" asked Noah.  "I don't have any friends."
said the dragon sadly.  "Well, maybe that's because you always gobble
them down," said Noah.  "Maybe you are right," said the dragon.  "I
will not gobble you down.  Let's be friends."  "Okay," said Noah.
"Can I ride on your back?" "Sure," said the dragon.  So they flew to
Cleveland.

THE END.
