Once upon a time, Brent and Noah were in a house.  It was dark because
it was night.  All of a sudden, they heard a very spooky noise. It
sounded like this: "OOOOOOOOO".  "What's that!?" Noah said.  He
jumped. Brent was scared.  Noah said, "Let's find out what that noise
is." And I looked and I found what was making the sound.  It was a
.... big.... what?! WHAT is THAT?!  And I thought and thought and I
knew what that was.  It was a ginormous magic monster! And he was
going to get us into a movie theater with tons of magic monsters.  And
all of them were having a bad movie.  It was bad for us.  But it was
good for the monsters.  And we told the monster to get us out of
there!  And he said, "NO!  I will not let you out for one YEAR!"  And
past half year, when no one was looking, we sneakily went out the door
without making a sound. And we went out the entrance and exit door and
what?  It was nighttime!  And Noah used his owl eyes and I looked
around everywhere and I saw some lights coming to their house. And
then I saw the monster go into our house!

THE END.
